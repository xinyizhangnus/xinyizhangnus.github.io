I am a Ph.D. candidate in Information Systems and Analytics at the National University of Singapore (NUS). My supervisors are Professor [Goh Khim-Yong](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/disa/people/gohky/) and Associate Professor [Chenshuo Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2Au0MzIAAAAJ).

My research interests involve (1) AI in e-commerce, and (2) societal and business impacts of digital platforms. I employ econometrics, randomized field experiments, and natural language processing. I enjoy exploring new technologies and approaching research questions from novel perspectives.

I am on the **2025–2026 job market**. Please feel free to contact me for research collaborations or job opportunities.
